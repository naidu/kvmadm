# Source Snapshots of KVMADM #

In the **Downloads** section, one may see tarballs named like `kvmadm-0-17-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.tar.gz`. These files are snapshots taken from the development directory with `make sdist` (file name contains actual date of snapshot). Since Google Code does not allow to delete downloads, and due to small size, older snapshots are to stay here forever, but it is recommended to download the most recent one.

Snapshots are taken irregularly, as some new feature is added, or a major bug fixed.
